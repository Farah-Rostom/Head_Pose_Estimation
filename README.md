# Head Pose Estimation
### <br>Supervised Machine Learning Classification Model</br>
The main objective of this model is to find the relative orientation (and position) of the human’s head using 2d face landmarks extracted using mediapipe library. In particular, in the head pose estimation task, it is common to predict relative orientation with Euler angles – yaw, pitch and roll. They define the object’s rotation in a 3D environment.
